# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
Connect to various APIs, retrieve selected data, E-T-L the data and then perform statistical analysis against a hypothesis.

## Process
Choose an interesting location and use requests and pandas libraries in python to generate a .csv file with data from the CityBikes API \n
Repeat the process at the same location for FourSquare and Yelp APIs \n
Combine the data in the .csv files by converting to pandas dataframes \n
Use data visualization libraries such as matplotlib to perform Exploratory Data Analysis \n
Perform statistical analysis using statsmodels on the CityBikes data vs Foursquare and Yelp data \n

## Results


## Challenges 
Using and combining different languages \n
Personal mental block

## Future Goals
Attempt different approaches to statistical model building \n
Write functions to be able to easily input different locations and run the whole process
